Description
----
This repo contains a simple card game that can be played from the console called
the "Hilo Game."

A player is given a deck of 13 cards. A new card is drawn during each turn. The
objective of the game is for the player to guess whether the next card will be
higher or lower than the card before it. If they guess correctly, the player gets
100 points. A wrong guess will result in losing 75 points. The player starts with
300 points. If the score goes to zero, the game ends.
